# STH-COMET - CHECKING SERVICE HEALTH

Background:
   Given I set the tutorial 303


# STH-Comet - Checking Service Health
#   curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8666/version'
# 1 - Request
 Scenario: Checking sth service health
   When  I prepare a GET HTTP request to "http://localhost:8666/version"
   And   I perform the query request
   Then  I receive a HTTP "200" status code response

 # Generating Context Data....
 # Open a door, switch a Smart lamp...
 # TODO - xxxx

# Minimal mode - Subscribing STH-Comet to Context Changes
# curl -iX POST \
# 'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions/' \
# -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
# -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
# -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'  @d 02.req.SubsbribeSthComent.json

# 2 - Request - Subscribing STH Coment to Context Changes
  Scenario: 2. Subscribe sht-comet to changes in Orion
    When  I prepare a POST HTTP request to "http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions/"
    And   I set header fiware-service to openiot
    And   I set header fiware-servicepath to /
    And   I set the body request as described in 02.req.SubsbribeSthComent.json
    And   I perform the request
    Then  I receive a HTTP response with status 201 and empty dict

# 3 - Request - Subscribing STH Coment to Lamp luminosity
  Scenario: 3. Subscribe sht-comet to changes in luminosity
    When  I prepare a POST HTTP request to "http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions/"
    And   I set header fiware-service to openiot
    And   I set header fiware-servicepath to /
    And   I set the body request as described in 03.req.SubscribeSthLampLuminosity.json
    And   I perform the request
    Then  I receive a HTTP response with status 201 and empty dict

 # 4 - Request - Test ORION Subsbriptions -- "The result should not be empty"
  Scenario: 4. Test that there are subscriptions in Orion
    When  I prepare a GET HTTP request to "http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001?options=keyValues"
    And   I set header fiware-service to openiot
    And   I set header fiware-servicepath to /
    And   I perform the query request
    Then  I receive a HTTP "200" response code


 # 4.5 - Request - Populate Lamp:001 history with curls
 Scenario Outline: Communicating with IoT Devices: Using Actuators
    # When  I prepare a POST HTTP request to "http://localhost:7896/iot/d?k=3314136&i=lamp001"
    When  I prepare a POST HTTP request to "http://localhost:7896/iot/d?k=<key_value>&i=<sensor>"
    And   I set header fiware-service to openiot
    And   I set header fiware-servicepath to /
    And   I set header Content-Type to text/plain
    And   I set simple sensor values as described in "<sensor_value>"
    And   I substitute in payload ";" for "|"
    And   I perform the request
    Then  I receive a HTTP "200" response code
    And   I wait "5" seconds
    Examples:
        | sensor_value  | key_value | sensor  |
        | s;ON;l;1750   | 3314136   | lamp001 |
        | s;ON;l;1800   | 3314136   | lamp001 |
        | s;ON;l;1775   | 3314136   | lamp001 |
        | s;ON;l;1725   | 3314136   | lamp001 |
        | s;ON;l;1760   | 3314136   | lamp001 |
        | s;ON;l;1790   | 3314136   | lamp001 |
        | s;ON;l;1810   | 3314136   | lamp001 |
        | s;ON;l;1830   | 3314136   | lamp001 |
        | s;ON;l;1720   | 3314136   | lamp001 |
        | s;ON;l;1550   | 3314136   | lamp001 |

   Given I wait "10" seconds
